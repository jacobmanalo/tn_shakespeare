# TN Shakespeare

Here, I take a simple Shakespeare GPT model that outputs text in the style of Shakespeare (heavily inspired by Andrej Karpathy's [nanogpt model](https://github.com/karpathy/nanoGPT)) and apply tensor network decomposition to each layer resulting in a model that contains 80% less parameters and maintains accuracy within 2%.
